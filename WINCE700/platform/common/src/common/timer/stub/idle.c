//  Function:     OEMIdle
//
//  This function is called by the kernel when there are no threads ready to 
//  run. The CPU should be put into a reduced power mode if possible and halted. 
//  It is important to be able to resume execution quickly upon receiving an 
//  interrupt.
//
//  It is assumed that interrupts are off when OEMIdle is called. Interrrupts
//  are also turned off when OEMIdle returns.
