//  Function:     OEMIdle
//
//  This function is called by the kernel when there are no threads ready to 
//  run. The CPU should be put into a reduced power mode if possible and halted. 
//  It is important to be able to resume execution quickly upon receiving an 
//  interrupt.
//
//  Interrupts are disabled when OEMIdle is called and when it returns.
//
//  This implementation doesn't change system tick. It is intend to be used
//  with variable tick implementation. However it should work with fixed
//  variable tick implementation also (with lower efficiency because maximal
//  idle time is 1 ms).
