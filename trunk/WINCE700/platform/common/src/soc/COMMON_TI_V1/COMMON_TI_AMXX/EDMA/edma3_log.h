/*
    Note : This header file is used to BIOS logs only. For porting purposes this
           file need to replace EDMA3_LOG_EVENT macro.

           This header file uses log format as defined by Socrates Instrumentation.
           Any change in the file will result in incorrect interpretation by Socrates Tool.

                                  BIOS Log Format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| TimeStamp | Sequence # | Event # | Event Descriptor | Data1 | Data2 | Data3 |
| (2 words) | by BIOS    | by BIOS |                  |       |       |       |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LogBuffer:          A single log buffer called DVTEvent_Log will be used for all event logs
TimeStamp:          Automatically inserted by BIOS Log_Printf4.
Sequence #:         Automatically inserted by BIOS Log_Printf4. This is used to detect data loss.
Event:              Name to uniquely identify event. This is the name that will be used in the visualization.
                    (Limitation: RTA requires the name to be a static global)
Event Descriptor:   The Event Descriptor is created using the EDMA3_DVT_DESC Macro.
                    This Macro is of the following format (see tables below for EventType and ArgType):
                    EDMA3_DVT_DESC(EventType, Arg1Type, Arg2Type, Arg3Type)

Note: Event # is generated by BIOS based on unique String provided as input to "Log_Printf4".
This string is extracted by Sorcates via the map file.

Note:
1. Only three pieces of data can be included in any log
2. Data needs to be included in the same order as in table.
   i.e. if logging INITIATOR, SIZE and CORR then INITIATOR
   must be in arg1, CORR in arg2 and SIZE in arg3

Example:

ISRx()
{
    Log_Printf4(&DVTEvent_Log, "ISR1", EDMA3_DVT_DESC(EDMA3_DVT_INT_eSTART, EDMA3_DVT_dNONE, EDMA3_DVT_dNONE,
        EDMA3_DVT_dNONE))
    :
    :
    Log_Printf4(&DVTEvent_Log, "ISR1", EDMA3_DVT_DESC(EDMA3_DVT_INT_eEND, EDMA3_DVT_dSIZE, EDMA3_DVT_dNONE,
        EDMA3_DVT_dNONE), sizeof(Buffer))
}
