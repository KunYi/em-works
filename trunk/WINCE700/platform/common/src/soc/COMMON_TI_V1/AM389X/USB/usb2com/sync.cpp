/*
 * Enhanced Critical Section API
 *
 * This module defines four functions that parallel the Win32 critical section
 * APIs but that provide some additional functionality.
 *
 * void InitCritSec_Ex (CritSec_Ex *this)
 *      Call this to initialize an enhanced critical section structure.
 *      The caller is responsible for allocating the structure. No other
 *      routines should be called on the structure until it has been
 *      initialized by this function. Do not initialize a structure more
 *      than once (excepting when it has been de-initialized first).
 *      Failure to abide by these rules will yield unpredicatable chaos.
 *
 * void DeleteCritSec_Ex (CritSec_Ex *this)
 *      Deletes the enhanced critical section structure (but doesn't free
 *      it - caller is responsible for that), deallocating all internally
 *      used system resources. Once this call returns, no threads are allowed
 *      to pass the structure to any of these calls except Init.
 *      !!!!!
 *      This call will block until the critical section can be safely deleted.
 *      !!!!!
 *      Once this call is made, all further attempts to Enter the critical
 *      section will fail. All pending Enter requests will be woken from their
 *      blocked states and be forced to fail. If another thread already owns
 *      the critical section then this function will block until that thread
 *      relinquishes control.
 *      The calling thread may or may not own the critical section when it
 *      calls this function. If it does own the critical section, it must
 *      not call Leave once the Delete operation returns, no matter how many
 *      nested Enter calls there were.
 *      If the caller of this function did not already hold the critical
 *      section for some other reason, it is more efficient for it to simply
 *      call Delete than for it to Enter the critical section first. This is
 *      because Delete forces other competing threads to abort whereas with
 *      Enter, a thread must wait its proper turn before initiating the Delete.
 *
 * void PrepareDeleteCritSec_Ex (CritSec_Ex *this)
 *      Initiates the destruction sequence. Using this call is optional.
 *      If used, it should be called only once and must then be followed
 *      up with a call to DeleteCritSec_Ex. This call has a bounded duration
 *      and when it returns other threads will behave as described for
 *      DeleteCritSec_Ex above. It does not wait for any such threads to finish,
 *      however, and so also does not clean up internal resources. That's why
 *      this must be followed up with a call to DeleteCritSec_Ex. Use this call
 *      when the delete operation has to be split into two phases.
 *
 * CritSec_Status EnterCritSec_Ex (CritSec_Ex *this, ULONG ulTimeout)
 *      Attempts to enter the enhanced critical section. The second argument,
 *      ulTimeout, specifies a maximum time (in milliseconds) to wait (as per
 *      the Win32 call WaitForSingleObject). Like Win32 critical sections,
 *      enhanced critical sections may be Enter'd recursively, in which case,
 *      the critical section is not relinquished until Leave has been called
 *      once for each time Enter was called.
 *      Possible return values are:
 *      o CSS_SUCCESS - caller now owns the enhanced critical section.
 *      o CSS_TIMEOUT - the non-INFINITE timeout expired before we gained
 *                      ownership; caller does not own the enhanced critical
 *                      section but may try to Enter it again.
 *      o CSS_DESTROYED - someone has Delete'd the enhanced critical section
 *                      and, as of the time at which this value is first
 *                      returned, it is no longer usable.
 *
 * void LeaveCritSec_Ex (CritSec_Ex *this)
 *      Relinquishes a previously Enter'd enhanced critical section.
 *      This call CAN block and CAN cause the scheduler to run. While the
 *      Win32 critical section it attempts to acquire can only be held for a
 *      bounded period of time, there is no bound to the time we may have to
 *      wait before being granted access to it.
 *      See also notes for Enter and Delete.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * o Using ulTimeout values other than 0 or INFINITE in the Enter call may have
 *   somewhat misleading results due to the implementation. Since it is possible
 *   for a thread to be woken but not be able to acquire the critical section
 *   (because the Win32 API does not give us a way to atomically grab a Win32
 *   critical section while waking up), we can wake up and block one or more
 *   times during the timeout interval, losing the race each time and, depending
 *   upon scheduler details, possibly reset any kernel fairness indications each
 *   time and cause us to timeout even though the section became available
 *   sometime during our interval. For the same reasons, an INFINITE timeout
 *   also leaves us vulnerable to starvation despite any in-kernel remedies.
 *
 * o Since the caller of these functions allocates the memory for the enhanced
 *   critical section structure (though not the internally used resources), we
 *   can guarantee that any number of attempted Enter's after a Delete will
 *   return CSS_DESTROYED, until the caller actually frees said memory. This is
 *   a potentially useful feature in that it prevents the need for an additional
 *   external flag while waiting for a module's auxilliary threads to finish
 *   shutting down.
