// This BSP uses the following versioning scheme
// x.yy.zz
// x  -> major release number, typically CE version number
// yy -> minor release number, typically incremented on every BSP release
// zz -> additional incremental release number that can be used to version 
// patches to an incremental release

// NOTE: The BSP version is displayed in the IDE using the BSP Properties 
//  window.  The information in this window comes from the FileVersion field
//  in the pbcxml file.  The FileVersion field in the PBCXML file must be
//  synchronized with the contents of this file.

// Note: do not use a leading zero, compiler interprets leading 0 as octal number
